In order to make an HTTP request to the server using JavaScript, you need an instance of a class that provides the necessary functionality. This is where XMLHttpRequest comes in. Such a class was originally introduced in Internet Explorer as an ActiveX object called XMLHTTP. Then, Mozilla, Safari, and other browsers followed, implementing an XMLHttpRequest class that supported the methods and properties of Microsoft's original ActiveX object. Meanwhile Microsoft had implemented XMLHttpRequest as well.
